# Motion Detection Using OpenCV
## Overview
### This project implements a real-time motion detection system using OpenCV and Python. It captures video from a webcam, detects motion by comparing frames, and highlights moving objects with bounding boxes.

## Features
### ✅ Detects motion in real-time using a webcam
### ✅ Draws bounding boxes around detected moving objects
### ✅ Displays "Moving Object Detected" when motion occurs
### ✅ Press 'q' to exit the program

## Technologies Used
### Python
